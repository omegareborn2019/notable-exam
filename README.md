Language: javascript
Frame: ReactJS
Database: mySQL

Instructions:
1, open terminal and run npm install
2, then run npm run build, then npm run nodemon
3, go to server folder => database folder => schema.sql => uncomment and copy everything
=> in a new terminal type mysql -uroot, once you are in the database => paste everything into the database
this should seed the database OR you can run schema file using some kind syntax.
4, open you brower and go to http://localhost:3000/ => this should show everything.

Note: I could have made doctors button working if I chose to use hardcoded data, database took me a long time to seed.
